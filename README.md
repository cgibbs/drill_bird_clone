I don't know how you found this, but don't expect it to ever be something that isn't dumb, lol.

The "Kirby with a mustache" sprite is inspiring. What if you could suck up blocks as an alternative to destroying them? How would that change the possibility space for puzzles?

Need a little "unstick" utility to make sure Kirby isn't stuck in collision with a block. Also, can't drop down single-block-wide holes if one of the objects is a thwomp? Maybe other cases, too? Needs investigating.

Kirby's dad needs a drilling sprite, so I guess make him literally hold a drill, lol.
