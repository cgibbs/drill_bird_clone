I don't know how you found this, but don't expect it to ever be something that isn't dumb, lol.

The "Kirby with a mustache" sprite is inspiring. What if you could suck up blocks as an alternative to destroying them? How would that change the possibility space for puzzles?

Need a little "unstick" utility to make sure Kirby isn't stuck in collision with a block. Also, can't drop down single-block-wide holes if one of the objects is a thwomp? Maybe other cases, too? Needs investigating.

Kirby's Dad needs a drilling sprite, so I guess make him literally hold a drill, lol.

A fun mechanics reveal could involve brick blocks with redstone in them that connect buttons to various things, and Kirby's Dad needs to manipulate them in order to proceed. At some point, a level shows up that's unsolveable, but the redstone is inside a moveable block, and the player learns that they can manipulate redstone connections through their normal block-manipulating tools. Bonus points for making them suck it up unexpectedly, like, in the pursuit of doing something else they suck it up and are like, "you can do that??????"
